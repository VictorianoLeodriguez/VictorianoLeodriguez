# 👋 Hi, I'm Enzo Victoriano Leodriguez

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **software developer** passionate about building solutions that involve **real challenges** and push my technical limits. I’m especially interested in **small tech companies and independent projects**, where innovation, ownership, and problem-solving matter more than rigid processes.

I started programming at a young age and have experience working with:

* Backend and system logic
* Databases and performance optimization

I strongly believe that the best way to learn is by **working on hard problems**, focusing on the **real business problem** and continuously improving the **end-user experience** of systems and applications.
